		<h3>Tips and questions about Pokémon Go :</h3>
<h4>Reload or upgrade?</h4>
<p>
Is it better to recharge or evolve? It depends on your situation. You should know that moving, Pokémon keep some data improvements by charging but will leave to zero in terms of CP (attack / life report giving the general level of the monster).
</p><p>
Also, if you build a Pokémon on the length, it does not matter. But if you want to conquer an arena quickly, better focus before recharging it evolve.
</p>
<h4>Evolve or capture?</h4>
<p>
As with all Pokémon games, go directly capture high-level monsters does not guarantee to have a better fighter. Better to focus its lead Pokémon over time rather than replace it quickly with the best level you find.
</p>
<h4>Hunting correctly Pokémon</h4>
<p>
In order to effectively expel a Pokemon, are using the interface of nearby Pokémon. Note that the list is ordered, which did in the example that the Pidgey is the closest to me, followed by Weedle, followed by Ratata. The Pokémon farthest from me is the last Ratata of the list.
</p><p>
More so, you can select a Pokemon hunt clicking. The lower right bar take shape. Be careful, as it will flash if you approach it!
</p><p>
Similarly, if the order of the nearest Pokémon changes, then the bar will flash green to alert you. It's time to see what is the loan, or change course if you are away.
</p>
<h4>Are there any shiny / color in the game?</h4>
<p>
For the moment, no chromatic cross Pokémon. A fake circulating on the net for green Zubat, do not be fooled.
</p>
<h4>Capture Pokémon and hatch the eggs very quickly</h4>
<p>Fool the GPS position of the device is quite possible ... but not very funny. A real sham real life, however, is to take public transportation to successfully capture more Pokémon possible.
</p><p>
Just for it to take a bus or a tram city for example. The speed of the transport that you can capture Pokémon on the route in an instant. This trick also works with the eggs, which will count as your route not!
</p>
<h4>How to evolve in a Pyroli Eevee, Jolteon, Vaporeon without stone?</h4>
<p>For connoisseurs of Pokémon, you know that there are a Pokémon that evolves under the influence of a stone: Eevee. This takes the shape you want on a stone you give. Eg stone lightning + = Jolteon Eevee.
</p><p>
In Pokémon Go, progress stones do not exist. The evolutions of Eevee is indeed decided to chance so if you change a Eevee via the conventional method of the game, you have no way to determine what changes you will receive.
</h4>
<h4>Do not use your candy right away</h4>
<p>Although it is tempting to see all aspects of the game right away, it does not make much sense to evolve Pokémon captured before level 5 view 6. Indeed, the level of Pokémon you encounter evolves over level your character.
</p><p>
In this slice level, the Pokémon will necessarily be very basic. evolve them now so would a candy mess, as you will see much more powerful CP happen very quickly for these basic monsters.
</p>
<h4>Do not buy with your money Pokéball</h4>
<p>
Fighting in arena you earn poképièces you can spend in the shop. Do not buy Pokéball! Indeed, Pokéstop are very generously provided by them. Better to focus on incense to maximize your catch.
</p>
<h4>Get Pokéball easily</h4>
<p>
Rather than spending your pennies, know that Pokéstop are regenerated every 5 minutes. If you are really hard up, nothing prevents you to wait quietly at the foot of a Pokéstop to redo your store Pokéball in fifteen minutes.
</p>
<h4>Launching a Pokéball is an experience bonus</h4>
<p>
Experience in the game is won by walking but also by capturing Pokémon. Know that if you start your Pokéball precisely on the monster, you will be granted a 50 XP bonus to capture.
</p><p>
Note that if you tend to not run right, or if you want to capture with style, you can keep you press the Pokéball and whirl until sparks appear. Through this, you will give effect to your ball. It is possible that it grants catch bonus, we still studying the issue.
</p>
<h4>Pay attention to the attacks of captured Pokémon</h4>
<p>
You captured two Pidgey a row to go to face the nearest grass arena? Good initiative, since the types are still important in the game, but be careful. Attacks of the same two pokemon may not be the same.
